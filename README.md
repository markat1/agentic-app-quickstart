## Mastering AI Agents and MCP: Build Enterprise Agentic Apps
# Agentic App Quickstart

This repo contains code examples, templates and assignments for the [Mastering AI Agents and MCP: Build Enterprise Agentic Apps](https://maven.com/rafael-pierre/building-agentic-ai-apps-with-mcp) [Maven](https://www.maven.com) course.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Use this template

This repo is a Github Template. You can quickly use it by creating on the "Use Template" button on top right. You can then create a clone of this repo in your own organization or profile. If you're not familiar with Templates, this is a nice guide: [link](https://dev.to/jajera/how-to-create-and-use-a-github-repository-template-2g7l)

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. Click the "Code" button on this repository
2. Select "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"
4. Wait for the environment to set up automatically

### Option 2: Local Development Container

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Steps:**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and set up

### Option 3: Other IDEs

You are free to use PyCharm, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, etc. Flow is mostly similar to running VSCode locally.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Included

The development environment comes pre-configured with:

- **Python 3.13**
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Modern, fast Python package manager
- **[openai-agents](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)** - Core library for agentic applications
- **[marimo](https://marimo.io/)** - Modern, interactive development notebooks
- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** - Modern web framework for APIs
- **Development tools** - ruff, pytest

## GPT API Keys

Configure the following environment variables in `.env`:

```
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.hexflow.ai"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you're experiencing connection issues (e.g. SSL Handshake Issues)
1. Try using mobile data instead of WiFi
2. Use this alternative URL: https://hexflow-g9bqfbexhmfyazat.z03.azurefd.net

üî¥ **IMPORTANT**: `.env` is already included in `.gitignore`, so it won't be pushed to your Github Repo. Don't remove it from there and don't store these credentials elsewhere, otherwise the will be publicly available!

## üì¶ Package Management

This template uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable Python package management:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -U pip uv
uv sync

# Add new packages
uv add package-name
uv venv

# Run commands with uv run
uv run python examples/code/01...
```

## üîß Customization

You can customize the development environment by editing:
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Container configuration

## üîí Security Features

This project includes several security measures to prevent accidental exposure of API keys:

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **API Key Detection**: Automatically checks `.env.example` files for real API keys before commits
- **Code Quality**: Runs `ruff` for linting and formatting
- **General Security**: Detects private keys, large files, and other security issues

### Manual Security Check
You can manually check your `.env.example` file anytime:
```bash
uv run python scripts/check_env_example.py .env.example
```

### CI/CD Security
- GitHub Actions automatically run security checks on all PRs
- Prevents merging code with potential API key leaks

**Remember**: Always use placeholder values in `.env.example` and keep real API keys in `.env` (which is gitignored)!
