## Mastering AI Agents and MCP: Build Enterprise Agentic Apps
# Agentic App Quickstart

This repo contains code examples, templates and assignments for the [Mastering AI Agents and MCP: Build Enterprise Agentic Apps](https://maven.com/rafael-pierre/building-agentic-ai-apps-with-mcp) [Maven](https://www.maven.com) course.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Use this template

This repo is a Github Template. You can quickly use it by creating on the "Use Template" button on top right. You can then create a clone of this repo in your own organization or profile. If you're not familiar with Templates, this is a nice guide: [link](https://dev.to/jajera/how-to-create-and-use-a-github-repository-template-2g7l)

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. Click the "Code" button on this repository
2. Select "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"
4. Wait for the environment to set up automatically

### Option 2: Local Development Container

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Steps:**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and set up

### Option 3: Other IDEs

You are free to use PyCharm, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, etc. Flow is mostly similar to running VSCode locally.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Included

The development environment comes pre-configured with:

- **Python 3.13**
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Modern, fast Python package manager
- **[openai-agents](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)** - Core library for agentic applications
- **[marimo](https://marimo.io/)** - Modern, interactive development notebooks
- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** - Modern web framework for APIs
- **Development tools** - ruff, pytest

## GPT API Keys

Make sure that the following is part of your `.env` file at the root of this folder:

```
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.hexflow.ai"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you're experiencing connection issues (e.g. SSL Handshake Issues)
1. Try using mobile data instead of WiFi
2. Use this alternative URL: https://hexflow-g9bqfbexhmfyazat.z03.azurefd.net

üî¥ **IMPORTANT**: `.env` is already included in `.gitignore`, so it won't be pushed to your Github Repo. Don't remove it from there and don't store these credentials elsewhere, otherwise the will be publicly available!

## OpenAI Agents SDK Setup & Troubleshooting

### Configuring models

An OpenAI model is already configured for you in the `examples/helpers.py` module.

If you prefer to include model configuration in your custom modules, you can simply copy this excerpt:

```python

from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from agents.models.openai_chatcompletions import OpenAIChatCompletionsModel
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

def get_client():
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    base_url = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT")

    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError(
            "OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required. "
            "Please create a .env file with your API key. "
            "See .env.example for reference."
        )

    if not base_url:
        print("Warning: OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT not set, using default OpenAI endpoint")

    return AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)


def get_model():
    model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        openai_client=get_client(),
    )

    return model
```

### Errors

If you get errors like this one when running the examples:

```bash
Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Incorrect API key provided: your_ope************here. You can find your API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_api_key'}}
```

This indicates that [tracing](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/) is probably enabled. Make sure that the following line is part of your `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1
```
